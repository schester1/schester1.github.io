<h3 id="1">FastGIA: a GIA model in Julia </h3>

<p>GIA models are available in a number of programming languages and from multiple research groups. We (Roger Creel and I)translated a 1D GIA model originally written in Matlab by Jacqueline Austermann to the Julia Programming Language to gain some speed and efficiency. The code is publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/rcameronc/FastGIA.jl">github</a>. Feel free to reach out with any questions about the code!</p>
