<p>I am a PhD Candidate at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory studying the dynamics of ice sheets and sea-level change. I am driven by questions related to how ice sheets responded to past climate changes in order to better understand our modern ice in a warming world. My research involves some time inside modeling ice dynamcis and solid Earth cahnges, as well as time in the field collecting paleo sea-level data, and conducting GPS and radar surveys.
