## About Me
I am a graduate student in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University and member of the [Jacqueline Austermann Lab](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~jackya/)

My research focuses on how sea levels in the Northern Hemisphere have changed since the last glacial maxmimum.
