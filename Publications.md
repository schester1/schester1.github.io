GIA drove spatially variabily sea-level change along Northern Hemisphere coastlines during the Holocene. Near the margins of former ice sheets is a unique pattern of change characterised by sea level fall interrupted by a brief (1-3 kyr) period of rise, or transgression. The origins of this mid-Holocene transgression have been previously debated. We used a quite of GIA model simulations to show that the transgression was likely driven by a geodynamics process--we term 'reverse migration' of the peripheral bulge. We show how this previously unidentified process arises from a contrast in viscosty between Earth's upper and lower mantle. Finally, we use observations of the transgression to constrain this contrast in viscosity below the former Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets.
